# Cyber Security Internship - Task 2

##   Task Title:
**Analyze a Phishing Email Sample**

---

##   Phishing Email Used:
```
From: PayPal Support <support@paypalsecure.com>  
Subject: Your Account is Suspended!  

Dear Customer,  

Your PayPal account has been suspended due to suspicious activities. Please click the link below to verify your account immediately to avoid permanent suspension.  

ðŸ‘‰ [Click here to verify](http://paypal-security-check.ru)  

Failure to comply will result in account termination.  

Thank you,

##   Phishing Indicators Identified:

1. **Fake sender address** â€“ `support@paypalsecure.com` is not an official PayPal domain.
2. **Urgent language** â€“ Threatens account suspension to scare the user.
3. **Suspicious link** â€“ URL ends in `.ru` which is not associated with PayPal.
4. **Grammatical issues** â€“ Unprofessional wording and errors.
5. **Request for personal action** â€“ Asks user to verify via external link, which is unsafe.

##   Tools Used:
- Visual inspection
- Link hover method
- Common phishing knowledge

##   Header Analysis Note:
Header analysis could not be performed since the sample is not a real email.  
In real-world cases, tools like [MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) can help detect:
- Spoofing
- Relay IPs
- Authentication failures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
