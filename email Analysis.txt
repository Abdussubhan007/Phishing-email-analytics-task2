## Phishing Indicators Identified:

1. **Fake Sender Email:**  
   The sender address (`support@paypalsecure.com`) is not an official PayPal domain.

2. **Urgent Language:**  
   The email says “Your account is suspended!” and “Failure to comply will result in account termination” to scare the recipient.

3. **Mismatched Link:**  
   The hyperlink says “Click here to verify” but points to `paypal-security-check.ru`, a suspicious .ru domain.

4. **Grammar Issues:**  
   The email contains basic grammar problems like “verify your account immediately to avoid permanent suspension.”

5. **Unusual Request:**  
   Asking users to verify their account via email is a red flag for phishing.
